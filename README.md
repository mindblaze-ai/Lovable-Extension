   cd salesforce-data-reader
   ```

2. **Load Extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the extension directory (containing `manifest.json`)

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to Salesforce**
   - Log into any Salesforce org (Sandbox, Production, Developer Edition)
   - The extension automatically detects Salesforce pages

2. **Open the Data Reader**
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
   - Click "Open Data Reader Sidebar"
   - Or use the sidebar directly if already enabled

3. **Start Querying**
   - Use the Query Builder for guided query creation
   - Or write custom SOQL queries in the text area
   - Click "Execute Query" or press Ctrl+Enter

### Query Builder Guide

#### Object Selection
- Choose from all queryable objects in your org
- Both standard and custom objects are available
- Objects are sorted alphabetically for easy browsing

#### Field Selection
- Start typing to get autocomplete suggestions
- Shows field type and label for context
- Add multiple fields separated by commas
- Supports related object fields (e.g., `Account.Name`)

#### WHERE Clauses
Add filtering conditions to narrow results:
```sql
Name LIKE '%test%'
CreatedDate = TODAY
Amount > 1000
Industry = 'Technology'
IsActive = true
```

#### Examples
**Basic Query:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Email FROM User LIMIT 10
```

**Complex Query:**
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Account.Name, Amount, CloseDate 
FROM Opportunity 
WHERE StageName = 'Closed Won' 
AND CreatedDate = THIS_MONTH 
ORDER BY Amount DESC 
LIMIT 50
```

**Custom Object Query:**
```sql
SELECT Id, API_Key__c, Model__c 
FROM Mindblaze_Settings__c
```

### Export Options

**CSV Export:**
- Perfect for Excel or Google Sheets
- Preserves data types and formatting
- Handles special characters and line breaks

**JSON Export:**
- Ideal for developers and integrations
- Maintains object structure and relationships
- Includes Salesforce metadata

## Architecture

The extension consists of several components:

### Extension Components

1. **Manifest (manifest.json)**
   - Defines permissions and extension structure
   - Manifest V3 compliance for future-proofing

2. **Background Service Worker (background.js)**
   - Manages extension lifecycle
   - Handles session detection and storage
   - Coordinates communication between components

3. **Content Script (content.js)**
   - Runs on Salesforce pages
   - Extracts session tokens and instance URLs
   - Monitors navigation changes in Lightning

4. **Sidebar Interface (sidebar.html/css/js)**
   - Main user interface for queries and results
   - Responsive design that works in narrow sidebars
   - Real-time query execution and result display

5. **Popup Interface (popup.html/css/js)**
   - Quick access from browser toolbar
   - Connection status and diagnostics
   - Launch point for sidebar interface

### Security & Privacy

#### Data Handling
- **No External Transmission**: All data stays between your browser and Salesforce
- **Session Reuse**: Uses your existing Salesforce session tokens
- **Local Storage**: Only preferences and temporary data stored locally
- **No Analytics**: No usage tracking or data collection

#### Permissions
The extension requests these permissions:
- `activeTab`: To detect Salesforce pages
- `storage`: To save user preferences
- `scripting`: To extract session information
- `sidePanel`: To provide sidebar interface
- Host permissions for Salesforce domains

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Not Connected" Status:**
1. Verify you're on a Salesforce page
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Check if you're logged into Salesforce
4. Try logging out and back into Salesforce

**"No Salesforce session found":**
1. Make sure you're on a legitimate Salesforce domain
2. Check if your organization has session security restrictions
3. Try navigating to a different Salesforce page
4. Clear browser cookies and log back in

### Query Issues

**"Query execution failed":**
1. Verify your SOQL syntax is correct
2. Check that field names exist on the selected object
3. Ensure you have read permissions on the object/fields
4. Try simplifying the query to isolate issues

**"API call failed":**
1. Check if your session has expired (refresh the page)
2. Verify API access is enabled for your user/org
3. Some objects may have special access requirements
4. Try reducing the query complexity or limit

### Performance Tips

**For Large Datasets:**
- Use LIMIT clauses to control result size
- Add WHERE clauses to filter data
- Consider exporting in smaller chunks
- Use indexed fields in WHERE clauses when possible

**For Better Performance:**
- Avoid SELECT * queries
- Specify only needed fields
- Use selective WHERE clauses
- Consider relationship query limits
