Icons needed for Salesforce Data Reader Extension:

1. icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - For browser UI
2. icon32.png (32x32 pixels) - For toolbar and extension list
3. icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - For extension management page
4. icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - For Chrome Web Store

Suggested design:
- Base color: #1976d2 (Material Design Blue)
- Symbol: "SF" text or database/query icon
- Clean, professional appearance
- Works well on both light and dark backgrounds

Temporary note: For development, you can use any 16px, 32px, 48px, and 128px PNG images.
You can create these using any image editor or online icon generator.

For a quick solution, you can:
1. Use Chrome's default extension icon temporarily
2. Create simple solid color squares in the required sizes
3. Download icons from icon libraries like Material Design Icons or Font Awesome

The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome provides defaults),
but custom icons provide better branding and user experience.
